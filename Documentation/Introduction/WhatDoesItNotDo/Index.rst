What does it not do?
--------------------

- Quick Shop isn't useful, if you need things like cross selling or if you have a lot of products
  with a lot of attributes like colours and sizes.
- Quick Shop doesn't contend with complex shop solutions like Oxyd or Magento. For example: Quick
  Shop doesn't support features like cross-seling or bonus management. The management of variants is
  unsimilar.
