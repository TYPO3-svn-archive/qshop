Manually installation
---------------------

Not recommended – because of a missing manual only.

The manually installation of Quick Shop is complex and isn't recommended. The cause is:

- Quick Shop is a team-play of a lot of extensions and frameworks – especially of

  - the Browser – TYPO3 without PHP
  - Caddy – the TYPO3 shopping cart,
  - Foundation – the responsive framework – and 
  - Powermail.

A manually installation enables a lot unproper configurations with a lot of costs for bugfixing.

The manual for a manually installation enables a lot of unproper or missing statements.

I would be happy, if you are appreciative of a missing documentation for a manually installation.
