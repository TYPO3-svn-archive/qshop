.. _upgrades-1-from-version-30-workflow-2-upgrade-powermail-from-1x-to:

Upgrade Powermail from 1.x to 2.x, if you like
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The update is not obligate! Quick Shop is running with Powermail 1.x and Powermail 2.x.

It is more comfortable, to install the needed Powermail data and configuration by the Quick Shop
Installer, than by doing this job manually.

Powermail Update:

- Upgrade Powermail with your Extension Manager from 1.x to 2.x.
- Don't upgrade your database now.
- Update Powermail supported by the modul Web > Powermail. This will migrate the data of your
  Powermail 1.x tables to the Powermail 2.x tables.
- Update your database.
- Maintain the tabs [Billing Address] and [Delivery Address] of the Caddy plugin.
